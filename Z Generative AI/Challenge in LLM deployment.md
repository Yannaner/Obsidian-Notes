# Challenges in LLM Deployment and Solutions

## Broader Challenges with LLMs
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: LLMs have a knowledge cutoff based on their last training data. For example, a model trained in early 2022 might incorrectly identify Boris Johnson as the current British Prime Minister.
- **Complex Math**: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical operations as they do not perform actual calculations but rather predict the next token.
- **Hallucinations**: LLMs sometimes generate incorrect or fabricated information, such as describing a nonexistent plant like the "Martian Dunetree."

## Solutions to Overcome LLM Limitations
To address these challenges, LLMs can be connected to external data sources and applications. This can enhance their performance by providing up-to-date information and reducing errors.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Purpose**: RAG is a framework that enables LLMs to access external data sources at inference time, helping to overcome knowledge cutoff issues and reduce hallucinations.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Retriever**: A key component that encodes the user's input prompt and queries external data sources, such as vector stores, databases, or files.
  - **Query Encoding**: The input prompt is encoded and used to search for relevant documents or data from the external source.
  - **Expanded Prompt**: The retrieved information is combined with the original prompt to generate a more accurate completion.

### Example Use Case
- **Legal Discovery**: A lawyer can use RAG to query a corpus of documents, such as previous court filings, to find relevant information about a specific case. The LLM then generates a completion that includes the retrieved data, providing accurate and relevant responses.

### Benefits of RAG
- **Up-to-date Information**: RAG allows LLMs to access and use the latest data, overcoming the limitations of their training cutoff.
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: By providing real data from external sources, RAG helps prevent the model from generating incorrect information.

### External Data Integration
- **Types of Data Sources**:
  - **Local Documents**: Private wikis, expert systems, and other internal documents.
  - **Web Access**: Retrieving data from the internet, like Wikipedia pages.
  - **SQL Databases**: Interacting with structured data stored in databases.
  - **Vector Stores**: Storing vector representations of text, enabling efficient and relevant search based on semantic similarity.

### Implementation Considerations
- **Context Window Size**: External data sources need to be divided into smaller chunks that fit within the LLM's context window.
- **Data Retrieval**: Data should be stored and retrieved in a format that allows for easy access to relevant text. This is often achieved using vector stores, which facilitate fast and efficient searching.

### Conclusion
By integrating RAG and connecting LLMs to external data sources, you can significantly improve the performance and accuracy of your applications. This approach allows LLMs to provide up-to-date, relevant information, enhancing the user experience and reducing errors like hallucinations.
