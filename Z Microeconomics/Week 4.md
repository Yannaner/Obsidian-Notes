# Economics Elasticity Concepts

## Price Elasticity of Demand
The price elasticity of demand for a product \( x \) can be represented as \( E_x \):

$$
E_x = \frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded of } x}{\text{\% change in price of } x}
$$

**Definition**: Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a change in its price.

- Its elastic when the absolute value > 1
- We call *elastic* very responsive
- Its inelastic when the absolute value is < 1
- We can *Inelastic* 
- When the absolute value equal to 1 then it called unitary

- Total revenue = Quantity x Price

1. If inelastic, price goes up increases the total revenue
2. If Elastic, increase the price, the customer go down, hen the total revenue decrease

**Easy Explanation**: It shows how sensitive consumers are to price changes. If a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded, the demand is elastic. If a large change in price leads to only a small change in quantity demanded, the demand is inelastic.

**Example**: If the price of coffee increases by 10% and the quantity demanded decreases by 20%, the demand for coffee is elastic.
# Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to changes in its price. Several factors influence whether demand is elastic (sensitive to price changes) or inelastic (insensitive to price changes).

## 1. **Availability of Substitutes**
- **Explanation**: If there are close substitutes available for a product, consumers can easily switch to another product if the price rises.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: More substitutes make demand more elastic.
- **Example**: If the price of a particular brand of cereal increases, consumers can easily switch to another brand.

## 2. **Necessity vs. Luxury**
- **Explanation**: Necessities are goods that consumers need to buy, even if the price increases, while luxuries are not essential and can be forgone.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: Necessities have inelastic demand, while luxuries have more elastic demand.
- **Example**: Insulin for diabetics is a necessity, so its demand is inelastic. High-end electronics are luxuries, so their demand is more elastic.

## 3. **Proportion of Income Spent on the Good**(How expensive the good is)
- **Explanation**: The amount of income consumers spend on a good affects how sensitive they are to price changes.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: Goods that take up a larger portion of a consumer's income tend to have more elastic demand.
- **Example**: A significant increase in rent (a large expense) would likely reduce demand for renting a particular apartment, while a small increase in the price of chewing gum (a small expense) might not affect demand much.

## 4. **Time**
- **Explanation**: The amount of time consumers have to adjust to a price change can affect demand elasticity.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: Demand is more elastic in the long run because consumers have more time to find alternatives or adjust their behavior.
- **Example**: If gasoline prices rise, consumers may initially keep buying the same amount, but over time, they might switch to more fuel-efficient cars or use public transport.

## 5. **Addictiveness of the Good**
- **Explanation**: Some goods, particularly addictive substances, have a lower elasticity because consumers find it difficult to reduce consumption despite price increases.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: Addictive goods tend to have inelastic demand.
- **Example**: The demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic, even when prices rise due to taxes.

## 6. **Definition of the Market**
- **Explanation**: How broadly or narrowly a market is defined can influence the elasticity.
- **Impact on Elasticity**: A narrowly defined market (specific brands or types of products) usually has more elastic demand than a broadly defined market (general categories).
- **Example**: Demand for "soft drinks" is more elastic compared to the demand for "beverages" in general.

- Higher the price tend to be more elastic(because it is replaceable)
- Lower the price tend to be inelastic
## Price Elasticity of Supply
$$ E_s = \frac{\text{\% change in quantity supplied of } x}{\text{\% change in price of } x} $$
**Definition**: Price elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied of a good changes in response to a change in its price.

**Easy Explanation**: It shows how responsive producers are to price changes. If supply increases significantly when the price goes up, the supply is elastic. If supply changes little with a price change, it is inelastic.

**Example**: If the price of strawberries increases and farmers quickly produce more strawberries to sell, the supply of strawberries is elastic.

## Income Elasticity of Demand
$$ E_I = \frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded of } x}{\text{\% change in income}} $$
**Definition**: Income elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a change in consumers' income.

positive (+) Normal Goods
negative (-) Inferior goods

**Easy Explanation**: It indicates whether a good is a necessity or a luxury. If demand increases significantly as income rises, the good is considered a luxury. If demand changes little, the good is a necessity.

**Example**: If a person's income increases by 10% and they buy 15% more restaurant meals, the income elasticity of demand for restaurant meals is high.

## Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
$$ E_{xy} = \frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded of } x}{\text{\% change in price of } y} $$ Where: - $E_{xy}$ is the cross-price elasticity of demand. - $x$ represents the good of interest. - $y$ represents the other good whose price is changing.
**Definition**: Cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good changes in response to a change in the price of another good.

**Easy Explanation**: It shows the relationship between two goods. If an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in demand for another good, the goods are substitutes. If it leads to a decrease in demand for another good, the goods are complements.

**Example**: If the price of butter increases and the demand for margarine increases, butter and margarine are substitutes.

- If they  are complement then the cross price is gonna be ***negative***(gasoline and car, the more expensive the gasoline gets, the less you consume car)
- If they are substitues to each other, then the cross price is gonna be ***positive***

## Tax Incidence

**Definition**: Tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is divided between buyers and sellers in a market.

**Easy Explanation**: It explains who actually pays more of a tax—the consumers or the producers. The distribution depends on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.

**Example**: If a tax on cigarettes is imposed and smokers continue buying almost the same amount, most of the tax burden falls on consumers rather than producers.

A **per-unit tax ** is a **tax imposed on each unit of a good or service produced or consumed**. It is typically levied by the government as a way to generate revenue or discourage consumption.
