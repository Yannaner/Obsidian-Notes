## Supply and demand
#### The determinants of Demand
- The law of demand
	- Price increase, quantity demand decrease
	- Demand curve

#### Change in the price 
#### Change of the related product demand
- If product related, one is a "complement" of the other product, and it will effect the demand and the price of the other product
- A product change, it change the whole structure of the demand
- Shift to right, demand increases
- Shift to left, Demand decreases

- When your income goes up, demands on certain thing goes done, then that certain thing is a inferior good.
- Inferior good: It decrease when income goes up
- complement good: it change the demand of other things if two things are related

## Supply
price, price input, technology(the better the technology the lower the cost)
- ![[Pasted image 20240813203312.png]]
- The price increase(assuming everything else stays the same) then the *Quantity supplies goes up*
- Price of input increases, then the supply decreases

## Equilibrium
- Supply surplus: when the supply too much, the price decrease. 
- Supply shortage: When the demend is high but the supply is not enough, the price increase.
- When the demand = supply --> equilibrium(the market clarity price)
# Change in demand
## Ceteris parabus
- If the bread price increase, the price of tomato decrease because less people buy tomato to eat with bread.

## Consumer preferences changes
- Attendence of the consumer due to weather
- Reduce the value of the goods
- The demand curve will decrease --> the price will also decrease 

## Change in supply
- If some other 成本 increase like techonology
- The product price will increase, and the quantity will decrease

## Simultaneous change in supply and demand
- Demand force the price go down but quantity force the price go up
- Do the graph and analysis the equilibrium

-(Inferior goods see an increase in demand when incomes decrease.
