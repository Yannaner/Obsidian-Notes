# Definitions and Examples

## Fixed Input
**Definition:** A fixed input is a resource or factor of production that cannot be changed in the short run, regardless of the level of output.

**Example:** In a manufacturing plant, the size of the factory building is a fixed input. Whether the plant produces 100 or 1,000 units, the building's size remains the same.

## Variable Input

Variable cost = wage x the number of workers 

**Definition:** A variable input is a resource or factor of production that can be adjusted in the short run to change the level of output.

**Example:** Labor is a variable input. If a factory needs to increase production, it can hire more workers to meet the demand.

## Marginal Product

$$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$
**Definition:** Marginal product is the additional output produced by using one more unit of a variable input, while holding all other inputs constant.

**Example:** If adding one more worker in a bakery results in 10 additional loaves of bread, the marginal product of that worker is 10 loaves.

## Diminishing Marginal Returns to the Variable Input
**Definition:** Diminishing marginal returns occur when the addition of a variable input results in a progressively smaller increase in output, holding all other inputs constant.

**Example:** In a farm, as more workers are hired to harvest crops, each additional worker may contribute less to total crop yield as the field becomes crowded.

## Marginal Costs
**Definition:** Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred from producing one more unit of output.

**Example:** If producing 10 units of a product costs $100, and producing 11 units costs $110, the marginal cost of the 11th unit is $10.

Average variable cost = variable cost / quantity
Average Fixed cost = fixed cost / quantity

AVC + AFC = Average total cost = Total cost / quantity

```

## Efficient Scale
**Definition:** Efficient scale is the level of output at which a firm's long-run average cost is minimized, meaning it is producing at the lowest possible cost per unit.

**Example:** A factory that produces 500 units of a product at the lowest average cost per unit is operating at its efficient scale.


The change in total cost arising from producing one more unit of output is known as:
###### Marginal cost
The diminishing returns of a variable input will account for:
###### the upward slope of marginal cost.

When a firm produces more than the minimum-cost output, the cost of making each additional unit (marginal cost) is higher than the average cost of making all units (average total cost). As a result, the average total cost starts to increase. This is because, beyond this point, producing more becomes less efficient, often due to diminishing returns.


- **Average Fixed Costs (AFC):** Fixed costs are constant regardless of output level. To find average fixed costs, you divide total fixed costs by the number of units produced. If Cindy's fixed costs increase from $500 to $4,000, her average fixed costs will increase because sheâ€™s spreading a higher fixed cost over the same number of units (100 bird feeders).
    
- **Marginal Costs (MC):** Marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit. Since fixed costs do not affect the cost of producing each additional unit, an increase in fixed costs does not change the marginal cost.
    
- **Average Variable Costs (AVC):** Variable costs change with output level. Since the increase in fixed costs does not affect variable costs, average variable costs remain the same.
