## Rival Good
**Definition:** A rival good is a type of good that cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. When one person consumes a rival good, it reduces the amount available for others.

**Example:** A sandwich is a rival good because if one person eats it, another person cannot consume the same sandwich.

## Excludable Good
**Definition:** An excludable good is a good where it is possible to prevent people who have not paid for it from having access to it.

**Example:** A movie ticket is an excludable good because only those who pay for the ticket are allowed to enter the cinema and watch the movie.

## Common Resource
**Definition:** A common resource is a type of good that is non-excludable (people cannot be easily excluded from using it) but rival (use by one person reduces the amount available for others).

**Example:** A fishery in the ocean is a common resource because no one can be easily excluded from fishing there, but if one person catches a lot of fish, fewer fish are available for others.

## Free-Rider Problem
**Definition:** The free-rider problem occurs when individuals can benefit from a good or service without paying for it, which can lead to under-provision of that good or service.

**Example:** National defense is an example of the free-rider problem. Everyone benefits from national defense, but if it were funded voluntarily, some might choose not to pay, hoping others will cover the cost.

## Externalities
**Definition:** Externalities are costs or benefits of a transaction that affect third parties who are not involved in the transaction. They can be positive (beneficial) or negative (harmful).

**Example:** Pollution from a factory is a negative externality because it affects people living nearby who are not involved in the factory's operations.

## Public Goods
**Definition:** Public goods are goods that are non-rivalrous (one person's consumption does not reduce availability for others) and non-excludable (no one can be excluded from using them).

**Example:** A lighthouse is a public good because its light is available to all ships without reducing the light's usefulness to any one ship, and no ship can be excluded from benefiting from it.
