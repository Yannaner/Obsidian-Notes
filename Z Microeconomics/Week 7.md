## Monopoly
**Definition:** A monopoly is a market structure in which a single firm dominates the entire market, with no close substitutes for its product or service. This firm has significant control over the market price.
**Example:** The local utility company that provides electricity to a region with no other competitors is a monopoly.

|:------------------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| How many sellers?              | One      | A few     | Many                     |
| Is the product differentiated? | Unique   | Somewha   | Somewhat                 |


## Market Structure
**Definition:** Market structure refers to the organization and characteristics of a market, including the number of firms, the nature of the product, and the degree of competition. Common market structures include perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
**Example:** The market structure of the smartphone industry is an oligopoly, where a few large firms like Apple and Samsung dominate the market.

## Price-Making Firm
**Definition:** A price-making firm is one that has the power to set the price of its product rather than accepting the market price. This is typically found in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets.
**Example:** A pharmaceutical company that produces a patented drug can set the price of the drug because it has a unique product with no close substitutes.

## Market Power
**Definition:** Market power is the ability of a firm or group of firms to influence or control the price and quantity of a product in the market. Firms with significant market power can set prices above competitive levels.
**Example:** A major tech company like Google has substantial market power in the online search engine market, allowing it to influence advertising rates.

## Price Discrimination

You need some market power in order to do price discrimination

Prevent reselling

**Definition:** Price discrimination occurs when a firm charges different prices to different consumers for the same product or service, based on factors like willingness to pay, location, or time of purchase.
**Example:** Airlines often practice price discrimination by charging different fares for the same flight based on when the ticket is purchased or the class of service.

## Pricing
**Definition:** Pricing refers to the process of determining the amount of money charged for a product or service. This involves considering costs, competition, demand, and market conditions.
**Example:** A restaurant sets its menu prices based on the cost of ingredients, competition in the area, and the target market's willingness to pay.

Price discrimination leads to a **lower price** for consumers with a **more elastic** demand. This is because consumers with more elastic demand are more sensitive to price changes, so to capture these consumers, the firm will offer a lower price.

A deadweight loss arises in monopoly because the monopolist produces less than the socially optimal quantity, which would occur in a perfectly competitive market. As a result, there are transactions where the value to consumers exceeds the cost of production, but these transactions do not occur because the monopolist sets a higher price and restricts output to maximize profits. This leads to a loss of total economic welfare, known as deadweight loss.
