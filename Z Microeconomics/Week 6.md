## Economic Profits
**Definition:** Economic profits are the difference between total revenue and total costs, including both explicit and implicit costs. Unlike accounting profits, economic profits consider opportunity costs.
**Example:** If a business earns $150,000 in revenue, incurs $100,000 in explicit costs, and has $30,000 in opportunity costs, its economic profit would be $20,000 ($150,000 - $100,000 - $30,000).

*Economic profits need to minus opportunity cost*

If Marginal revenue < Marginal cost, then you should cut production
 
## Perfect Competition
**Definition:** Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by many small firms selling identical products, with no single firm having any control over the market price. Entry and exit from the market are easy, and all firms are price takers.
**Example:** The agricultural market for wheat is often considered a good example of perfect competition, where many farmers sell identical wheat at market-determined prices.

###### Competitors are price takers
## Price Taking Firm
**Definition:** A price-taking firm is one that cannot influence the market price of its product and must accept the prevailing market price. This is typical in a perfectly competitive market.
**Example:** A dairy farmer in a large market where the price of milk is set by overall supply and demand conditions is a price-taking firm.

###### Shut down when price is < average variable cost


## Break-even Price
**Definition:** The break-even price is the price at which a firm's total revenue equals its total costs, resulting in zero economic profit. It is the minimum price the firm must charge to cover all its costs.
**Example:** If a bakery has total costs of $1,000 and sells 100 cakes, the break-even price per cake would be $10 ($1,000 / 100 cakes).

## Profit Maximizing Output
**Definition:** The profit-maximizing output is the level of production at which a firm achieves the highest possible profit. This occurs where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR).
**Example:** A toy manufacturer finds that producing 500 toys maximizes profit because at this output level, the cost of making one more toy equals the revenue gained from selling it.

## Long Run Supply Curve
**Definition:** The long run supply curve shows the relationship between market price and quantity supplied when firms can enter or exit the market. In a perfectly competitive market, the long-run supply curve is typically horizontal, reflecting constant costs across the industry.
**Example:** In the solar panel industry, if the cost of production remains constant regardless of the number of firms in the market, the long run supply curve would be a flat line, indicating that supply adjusts to meet demand without affecting price.

In a free market economy, it's tempting to think that businesses can simply charge whatever people are willing to pay for a product or service. While this may hold true in the short run, it's important to consider the long-run dynamics, which involve both demand and average costs.

Let’s consider the example of the smartphone industry. When a new, innovative smartphone enters the market, early adopters are often willing to pay a premium price for it. This high demand allows the manufacturer to charge a lot, and in the short run, this strategy works because people perceive the product as valuable and unique.

However, in the long run, the scenario changes. As other companies observe the high prices and the substantial demand, they’re incentivized to enter the market, either by producing similar smartphones or by finding ways to innovate further. This increases competition, which drives prices down. Additionally, over time, the costs of producing the smartphone tend to decrease due to factors like economies of scale, technological improvements, and learning curves.

As competition intensifies, businesses can no longer sustain the high prices that were possible in the short run. To remain competitive, they must lower prices, which eventually brings the market price closer to the average cost of production. If companies continue to charge excessively high prices, they risk losing customers to competitors offering similar products at a lower price. In the long run, the price of smartphones will generally settle at a point where it covers the average cost of production plus a normal profit margin, reflecting both the supply side (costs) and the demand side (willingness to pay).

A real-world example of this is seen in the history of flat-screen televisions. When they were first introduced, prices were exorbitant because of the novelty and high production costs. However, as the technology became more widespread and manufacturing processes improved, prices dropped significantly. What was once a luxury item is now affordable to a much larger segment of the population.

Therefore, while your friend is partially right in stating that businesses will charge a lot if people are willing to pay a lot, this is more of a short-run phenomenon. In the long run, prices are influenced by competition and average costs, leading to a more balanced market where prices align with the costs of production and the forces of supply and demand.
