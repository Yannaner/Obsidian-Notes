## Equilibrium
**Equilibrium** occurs in a market when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. At this point, the market price stabilizes, and there is no tendency for the price to change, as supply and demand are balanced.

## Consumer Surplus
**Consumer surplus** is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and what they actually pay. It represents the extra benefit or value consumers receive from purchasing a product at a lower price than they were prepared to pay.

## Producer Surplus
**Producer surplus** is the difference between the price producers receive for a good or service and the minimum price they are willing to accept to produce it. It represents the extra benefit or profit producers receive by selling at a market price higher than their minimum acceptable price.

## Total Surplus
**Total surplus** is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus in a market. It measures the overall economic well-being and efficiency of a market, representing the total net benefit to society from the production and consumption of goods and services.

## Price Ceilings
**Price ceilings** are government-imposed limits on how high a price can be charged for a good or service. When a price ceiling is set below the market equilibrium price, it can lead to shortages as demand exceeds supply.

## Price Floors
**Price floors** are government-imposed limits on how low a price can be charged for a good or service. When a price floor is set above the market equilibrium price, it can lead to surpluses as supply exceeds demand.

Total surplus in the market is equal to:


the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.


If the price of a good is held below the equilibrium price, the lower price will encourage more consumers to want the good, but producers will be less willing to supply it at that price. This creates a situation where the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, leading to a shortage.

The correct answer is:

quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied.


A price floor imposed above the equilibrium price of a good sets a minimum price that is higher than what the market would naturally set. This typically leads to a situation where suppliers are willing to produce and sell more of the good at the higher price, but consumers are not willing to buy as much at that price. As a result, there is an excess supply, also known as a surplus.

The correct answer is:

a supply surplus.
