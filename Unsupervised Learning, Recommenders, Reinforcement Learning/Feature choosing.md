# Tuning Features for Anomaly Detection

Choosing the right features for anomaly detection is crucial. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm can rely on labeled data to determine feature importance, anomaly detection learns from unlabeled data, making feature selection even more critical. Here are some practical tips for optimizing your features.

## Gaussian Transformation

### Why Gaussian?
Anomaly detection algorithms often perform better when the input features follow a Gaussian distribution. If your features are not Gaussian, transforming them to be more Gaussian can improve the performance of your algorithm. 

### Identifying Non-Gaussian Features
Plot a histogram of your features to check their distribution. For example:

If your histogram does not resemble a bell-shaped curve, the feature is not Gaussian. 

### Transforming Features
To make features more Gaussian, consider the following transformations:

- **Log Transformation**: If a feature $X$ has a skewed distribution, try using $\log(X)$. If $X$ contains zeros, use $\log(X + c)$ where $c$ is a small constant.
- **Square Root Transformation**: For some features, using $X^{0.5}$ or $X^{\frac{1}{3}}$ can make the distribution more Gaussian.
- **Power Transformation**: Experiment with different exponents to find a transformation that works best. For example, $X^{0.4}$.

## Error Analysis and Feature Engineering

### Analyzing Errors
After training your anomaly detection model, examine the cross-validation set to see where the algorithm fails. Look at the examples it incorrectly labels as normal or anomalous and determine what features could help distinguish these cases.

### Adding New Features
Create new features that might highlight anomalies better. For example, if you are monitoring computers in a data center:

- You might start with features like memory use, number of disk accesses per second, CPU load, and network traffic volume.
- If the algorithm fails to detect certain anomalies, consider combining features. For instance, a high CPU load with low network traffic might be unusual. Creating a feature like the ratio of CPU load to network traffic could help.

By trying different transformations and adding new features, you can improve the performance of your anomaly detection algorithm. Ensure that any transformations applied to the training set are also applied to the cross-validation and test sets.
