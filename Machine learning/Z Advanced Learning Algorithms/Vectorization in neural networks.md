`numpy.matmul`
## Key Points

- `matmul` is used for matrix multiplication, not element-wise multiplication.
- For 2D arrays, it performs standard matrix multiplication.
- For 1D arrays, it performs the dot product.
- For mixed dimensions, it handles the arrays appropriately for matrix-vector multiplication.
- For higher-dimensional arrays, it follows broadcasting rules to perform tensor multiplication.
