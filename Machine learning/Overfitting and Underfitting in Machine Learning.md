### Linear Regression Example

- **Underfitting (High Bias):**
    - When a model does not capture the underlying trend of the data.
    - Example: Predicting housing prices with a linear model.
    - A straight-line fit may not capture the pattern where housing prices flatten as the house size increases.
    - This results in high bias or a strong preconception that the data is linear, despite evidence to the contrary.
    - **Graph:**

- **Just Right:**
    - Adding quadratic terms (e.g., \(x\) and \(x^2\)) can improve the model fit.
    - The model captures the trend better and generalizes well to new examples.

- **Overfitting (High Variance):**
    - When a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise rather than the underlying pattern.
    - Example: Using a fourth-order polynomial to fit housing prices.
    - The model fits all training points perfectly but performs poorly on new data.

### Bias and Variance

- **High Bias (Underfitting):**
    - The model is too simple to capture the data's complexity.
    - High bias causes the model to miss relevant relations between features and the target output.
    
- **High Variance (Overfitting):**
    - The model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data.
    - High variance leads to a model that captures random noise rather than the intended outputs.

### Classification Example

- **Underfitting (High Bias):**
    - Simple logistic regression model with a linear decision boundary.
    - The straight line does not separate the data well.
    - **Graph:**

- **Just Right:**
    - Adding quadratic terms (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2\)) forms an elliptical decision boundary.
    - Better separation of classes and good generalization.
    - **Graph:**

- **Overfitting (High Variance):**
    - Using a high-order polynomial to fit the decision boundary.
    - The model fits the training data perfectly but fails to generalize to new examples.

## Addressing Overfitting and Underfitting

- **Goal:**
    - Find a model that is neither underfitting nor overfitting.
    - Achieve a balance between bias and variance, akin to Goldilocks' porridge that is "just right".

- **Regularization:**
    - A technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function.
    - Encourages simpler models that generalize better to new data.
