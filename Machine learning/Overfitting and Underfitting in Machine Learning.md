### Linear Regression Example

- **Underfitting (High Bias):**
    - When a model does not capture the underlying trend of the data.
    - Example: Predicting housing prices with a linear model.
    - A straight-line fit may not capture the pattern where housing prices flatten as the house size increases.
    - This results in high bias or a strong preconception that the data is linear, despite evidence to the contrary.
    - **Graph:**

- **Just Right(Generalization):**
    - Adding quadratic terms (e.g., \(x\) and \(x^2\)) can improve the model fit.
    - The model captures the trend better and generalizes well to new examples.
    - **Graph:**

- **Overfitting (High Variance):**
    - When a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise rather than the underlying pattern.
    - Example: Using a fourth-order polynomial to fit housing prices.
    - The model fits all training points perfectly but performs poorly on new data.

### Bias and Variance

- **High Bias (Underfitting):**
    - The model is too simple to capture the data's complexity.
    - High bias causes the model to miss relevant relations between features and the target output.
    
- **High Variance (Overfitting):**
    - The model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data.
    - High variance leads to a model that captures random noise rather than the intended outputs.

### Classification Example

- **Underfitting (High Bias):**
    - Simple logistic regression model with a linear decision boundary.
    - The straight line does not separate the data well.
    - **Graph:**
        ![[Pasted image 20240709141136.png]]

- **Just Right:**
    - Adding quadratic terms (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2\)) forms an elliptical decision boundary.
    - Better separation of classes and good generalization.
    - **Graph:**
        ![[Pasted image 20240709141200.png]]

- **Overfitting (High Variance):**
    - Using a high-order polynomial to fit the decision boundary.
    - The model fits the training data perfectly but fails to generalize to new examples.

## Addressing Overfitting and Underfitting

- **Goal:**
    - Find a model that is neither underfitting nor overfitting.
    - Achieve a balance between bias and variance, akin to Goldilocks' porridge that is "just right".

- **Regularization:**
    - A technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function.
    - Encourages simpler models that generalize better to new data.

# Addressing Overfitting in Machine Learning

egies to Address Overfitting

### 1. Collect More Training Data

- **Description:**
    - Increasing the amount of training data can help the learning algorithm generalize better.
    - More data helps the model learn a less complex and more accurate function.
    - **Example:** In house price prediction, gathering more data points on house sizes and prices can help the model avoid fitting a wiggly function.
- **Graph:**

- **Limitation:**
    - Not always feasible to collect more data, especially in cases where data is limited or expensive to obtain.

### 2. Use Fewer Features

- **Description:**
    - Reducing the number of features can help prevent the model from overfitting.
    - Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features for the prediction task.
    - **Example:** Instead of using 100 features like size, bedrooms, age, and distance to the nearest coffee shop, use only the most relevant ones like size, bedrooms, and age.
- **Graph:**
    ![Fewer Features](path/to/fewer_features.png)

- **Limitation:**
    - Using fewer features might result in losing valuable information.
    - Later in Course 2, you'll learn algorithms for automatic feature selection to address this.

### 3. Regularization

- **Description:**
    - Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function to discourage overly complex models.
    - It reduces the magnitude of the parameters, shrinking them towards zero without eliminating them.
    - **Example:** Even with higher-order polynomial features, regularization can help the model fit the training data better by preventing the parameters from becoming too large.
- **Graph:**
    ![Regularization](path/to/regularization.png)

- **Details:**
    - Regularization keeps all features but controls their impact.
    - Typically, only the \( w \) parameters are regularized, not the bias term \( b \).
    - This approach is widely used, including in training neural networks.

## Practical Tips and Recap

- **Collect More Data:** Effective but not always feasible.
- **Feature Selection:** Useful to reduce overfitting, but be cautious of losing important information.
- **Regularization:** A flexible and powerful technique that you'll learn to apply in detail in the next video.

### Lab on Overfitting

- **Optional Lab:**
    - Interactive lab to build intuition about overfitting and methods to address it.
    - Experiment with regression and classification examples.
    - Adjust polynomial degree and explore the effects of adding training data and selecting features.

In this video, we introduced regularization at a high level. The next video will dive deeper into how to apply regularization, its formulation, and how to integrate it with learning algorithms to prevent overfitting in linear and logistic regression, as well as other algorithms. Let's continue to the next video to explore these concepts further.
