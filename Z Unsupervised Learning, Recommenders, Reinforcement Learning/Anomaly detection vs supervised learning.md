# Anomaly Detection vs. Supervised Learning: When to Use Each

When dealing with datasets containing a few positive examples (\( y = 1 \)) and many negative examples (\( y = 0 \)), choosing between anomaly detection and supervised learning can be subtle. Here are some thoughts and suggestions to help you decide.

## Anomaly Detection

### When to Use:
- **Few Positive Examples**: Typically, anomaly detection is more appropriate when you have 0-20 positive examples and a large number of negative examples.
- **Diverse Anomalies**: If there are many ways an anomaly can manifest, or if new anomalies are likely to appear, anomaly detection can be more effective. 

### Key Characteristics:
- **Learning from Negative Examples**: The parameters for \( p(x) \) are learned only from negative examples, with positive examples used mainly for tuning and evaluation.
- **Detecting Deviations**: Anomaly detection models normal behavior and flags significant deviations as anomalies. This is useful for detecting new types of anomalies that have not been previously observed.

### Examples:
- **Financial Fraud Detection**: New types of fraud appear regularly, making anomaly detection suitable for identifying transactions that deviate from the norm.
- **Manufacturing Defects**: Detecting new, previously unseen defects in products.
- **Security Monitoring**: Identifying unusual behavior in systems that might indicate a hack, as hackers continually find new ways to breach systems.

## Supervised Learning

### When to Use:
- **Larger Number of Positive Examples**: When you have a sufficient number of positive and negative examples to train a model effectively.
- **Similar Future Examples**: If future positive examples are expected to be similar to the ones in the training set, supervised learning is appropriate.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Learning from Both Positive and Negative Examples**: Supervised learning algorithms learn patterns from both positive and negative examples.
- **Assumption of Consistency**: It assumes future anomalies will be similar to those seen in the training data.

### Examples:
- **Email Spam Detection**: Spam emails tend to have similar characteristics over time, making supervised learning effective.
- **Weather Prediction**: Predicting common weather types (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy) based on historical data.
- **Disease Diagnosis**: Using known symptoms to diagnose diseases that have been previously observed.

## Practical Tips

### Anomaly Detection:
- **Evaluate Using Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to tune parameters like epsilon and ensure the algorithm detects anomalies without flagging too many normal examples.
- **Focus on Features**: Spend time tuning the features used in the anomaly detection algorithm to improve its effectiveness.

### Supervised Learning:
- **Adequate Training Data**: Ensure you have enough positive examples to capture the variety in the positive class.
- **Consistency in Data**: Use supervised learning when you expect future anomalies to be similar to the training examples.

## Summary

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use when you have few positive examples, expect new types of anomalies, and need to model deviations from normal behavior.
- **Supervised Learning**: Use when you have enough positive examples, and future positive examples are expected to be similar to those in the training set.
